# Getting Started with Open Source in the Enterprise

------------
Welcome to our course on **Getting Started with Open Source in the Enterprise**. We are excited to join you in this journey and look forward to helping you meet your OSS goals.

### How It Works

This is not your average training course. This is a self-guided journey, where we will be supporting you and your team in creating the necessary documents to define and communicate your Open Source program.

We like to call this repository an **Open Source Tool Kit**. It doesn't look like much right now, but when we are done with this repository, you will move it to your own  GitHub organization where it will become a resource for the developers inside your organization who are using, contributing or releasing Open Source projects.

This is a **learning** repository. You will see that the `github-learning-lab` bot will open some Issues and Pull Requests for you. The best part is, even though these Issues and Pull Requests will be merged/closed as we move through the course, they will still be there -- and serve as a treasure trove of information -- for those who join the repository later.  

### Getting Started

We hope you are excited to get started! Head over to the take your first steps toward a :sparkles: Open Source program for your company.
